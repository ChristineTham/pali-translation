2. At that time the Buddha, the Blessed One, was dwelling at Uruvelā, on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the foot of the Bodhi tree, having just attained full enlightenment. Then the Blessed One sat at the foot of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one posture, experiencing the bliss of liberation. Then the Blessed One, during the first watch of the night, attended to dependent origination in forward and reverse order—

3. “With ignorance as condition, formations [arise]; with formations as condition, consciousness; with consciousness as condition, name-and-form; with name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases; with the six sense bases as condition, contact; with contact as condition, feeling; with feeling as condition, craving; with craving as condition, clinging; with clinging as condition, existence; with existence as condition, birth; with birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair come into being. Thus is the origination of this whole mass of suffering.

4. But with the remainderless fading away and cessation of ignorance, comes cessation of formations; with the cessation of formations, cessation of consciousness; with the cessation of consciousness, cessation of name-and-form; with the cessation of name-and-form, cessation of the six sense bases; with the cessation of the six sense bases, cessation of contact; with the cessation of contact, cessation of feeling; with the cessation of feeling, cessation of craving; with the cessation of craving, cessation of clinging; with the cessation of clinging, cessation of existence; with the cessation of existence, cessation of birth; with the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, displeasure, and despair cease. Thus is the cessation of this whole mass of suffering.”

5. Then the Blessed One, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this inspired utterance—

6. _“When indeed phenomena become manifest_ \
_To the ardent, meditating brahmin;_ \
_Then all his doubts disappear,_ \
_When he understands the phenomenon with its cause.”_

1. At that time, the Buddha, the Blessed One, was dwelling in Uruvelā, on the bank of the river Nerañjarā, at the foot of the Bodhi tree, having just attained full enlightenment. Then the Blessed One sat at the foot of the Bodhi tree for seven days in one cross-legged posture, experiencing the bliss of liberation. Then the Blessed One, during the first watch of the night, attended to dependent origination in forward and reverse order—

2.  “From ignorance as condition, formations [arise]; from formations as condition, consciousness [arises]; from consciousness as condition, name-and-form [arises]; from name-and-form as condition, the six sense bases [arise]; from the six sense bases as condition, contact [arises]; from contact as condition, feeling [arises]; from feeling as condition, craving [arises]; from craving as condition, clinging [arises]; from clinging as condition, becoming [arises]; from becoming as condition, birth [arises]; from birth as condition, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair arise. Thus is the origination of this entire mass of suffering.

3.  But from the utter fading away and cessation of that very ignorance, [comes] the cessation of formations; from the cessation of formations, [comes] the cessation of consciousness; from the cessation of consciousness, [comes] the cessation of name-and-form; from the cessation of name-and-form, [comes] the cessation of the six sense bases; from the cessation of the six sense bases, [comes] the cessation of contact; from the cessation of contact, [comes] the cessation of feeling; from the cessation of feeling, [comes] the cessation of craving; from the cessation of craving, [comes] the cessation of clinging; from the cessation of clinging, [comes] the cessation of becoming; from the cessation of becoming, [comes] the cessation of birth; from the cessation of birth, aging-and-death, sorrow, lamentation, pain, grief, and despair cease. Thus is the cessation of this entire mass of suffering.”

4.  Then the Blessed One, having understood this matter, at that time uttered this inspired utterance—

5.  _“When indeed phenomena become manifest_ \
    _To the ardent, meditating brahmin,_ \
    _Then all his doubts vanish,_ \
    _Because he understands the phenomenon with its cause.”_
